    <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa</h1>
    <h2>
      E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. A foot accustomed to running
      over roots makes the speediest runner. (Optional SUB title) 10 November
      2010 Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks
      on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
      (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short
      distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to
      prepare the hangi. Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set
      off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived
      there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind,
      completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety
      Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On
      reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka
      (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill
      Whangatauatia. While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he
      was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
