    <h1>Javascript & the DOM</h1>

    <!-- Non-technical could mean writing this as if it was a blog post you would have wanted to read when you first started learning these concepts or to a friend who wants a better understanding of what you are learning. You should show examples of code and screenshots to help teach others!
An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.

Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. -->

      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
    </h2>

    <p>
      CSS is the architectural plan, HTML is the house, Javascript is the
      wiring, and you are the architect, the builder, and the electrician.
      Without the wiring to link everything up, what good is that fancy new
      house? Your lights won't work when you flick the switch, your heatpump
      won't make the house nice and toasty while you drive home from a long day
      at work, and you can forget about snapping your fingers to dim the lights
      and fade in some Barry White. We generally take some of these things for
      granted because we can't see the wires or understand how they work, but
      without them we would just be a bunch of apes hurtling through space on a rock.

      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life
    </h2>
    <p>
      Typically code runs from top to bottom, but with things such as
      conditionals and loops we can alter this flow to fulfill our needs. We can
      do things like load the important things first on a page so that the end
      user isn't left hanging. There are a few different types of loops. One of
      the most common is a for loop. An example would be if I wanted to eat some
      biscuits. I would first need to check to see if I had biscuits. If I
      didn't, I would need to buy more biscuits, and if I did have biscuits I
      would then eat them all. If I then ran the loop again, I would have no
      biscuits and need to buy more, thus creating an infinite biscuit glitch.
      Sometimes you need to break a loop or it runs indefinitely and crashes the
      browser. A good way to break this cycle would be to create a rule that says if I'm full, stop eating biscuits.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the document as nodes and
      objects so that different programming languages can interact with the page
      without the need to change the code at the source. It gives us a neat way
      of quickly making changes and trying out ideas without the risk of messing
      up our code. This could be very useful for demonstrating some options for
      a client.
