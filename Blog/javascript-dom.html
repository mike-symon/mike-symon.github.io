    <h1>Javascript & the DOM</h1>

    <!-- Non-technical could mean writing this as if it was a blog post you would have wanted to read when you first started learning these concepts or to a friend who wants a better understanding of what you are learning. You should show examples of code and screenshots to help teach others!
An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. -->

      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
    </h2>

    <p>
      CSS are the architectural plans, HTML is the house, Javascript is the
      wiring, and you are the architect, the builder, and the electrician.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without the wiring to link everything up, what good is that fancy new
      house? Your lights won't work when you flick the switch, your heatpump
      won't make the house nice and toasty while you drive home from a long day
      at work, and you can forget about snapping your fingers to dim the lights
      and fade in some Barry White.
    </p>
    <p>
      We generally take some of these things for granted because we can't see
      the wires or understand how they work, but without them we would just be a
      bunch of apes on a rock hurtling through space.
