    <h1>Javascript & the DOM</h1>

    <!-- Non-technical could mean writing this as if it was a blog post you would have wanted to read when you first started learning these concepts or to a friend who wants a better understanding of what you are learning. You should show examples of code and screenshots to help teach others!
An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. -->

      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
    </h2>

    <p>
      CSS is the building plans, HTML is the building, Javascript is the wiring,
      and you are the architect, the builder, the electrician, and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without the wiring linking everything up, what good is that fancy new
      house? Your key won't open that flash new electronic front door lock, your
      TV won't be beaming The Simpsons into your living room, and a snap of your
      fingers won't dim the lights and fade in the soothing sounds of Barry
      White.
