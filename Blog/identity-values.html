      Gather evidence to identify what your values are. The reflection gets you to examine and identify who you are at this point. This involves self-evaluation and seeking feedback from two or three trusted friends, family, whānau, colleagues. It will allow you to compare how you see yourself with how others see you.

Professional reference to come from Grant Major	
Character reference to come from Hayley Gastmeier	

Evidence might include:
* Stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice
* A testimonial/feedback from someone
* An achievement you are proud of
* Using a tool to help you surface and name the values most important to you
* Visuals or narratives that help you describe where your values came from
* Whakataukī (proverbs) or quotes that sum up your values
* Your review of learning.
* 
Gather evidence to identify your strengths and areas for development. Evidence might include personality or skills/capability assessment tools like:
* Myers Briggs
* Strengthsfinder
* DOPE
* Capability Sort
* Minded
* 
Document it
Next sprint, you will publish this document as a blog post which will be visible to your cohort and facilitator. Your blog participation counts towards your overall assessment. Until then, write your findings on a temporary document (word, google docs, text edit etc.).
1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
    * Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
    * Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
2. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
    * Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
    * Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
    * Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.

    <h2>My core values:</h2>

    <p>My core values are authenticity, curiosity, determination, growth, kindness, and efficiency. 
    There are some values I aspire to that I don’t feel like I have obtained yet. Wisdom for example, which I hope to achieve through my curiosity, growth and determination. I would have liked to add adventure to my list, but I have some work to do in the motivation area first.</p> 
    
    <h2>A situation where I had an ethical decision to make:</h2>
    
    <p>20 years ago just after my Mother first met her new partner, I uncovered one of her new partner’s “business websites” and found that he had listed me and some other family members as board members and executives of his company.
    I didn’t want to cause a rift in my family, but after some consideration, I called him out on it and it was eventually removed, but nobody else seemed to see what the big deal was. 
    For the next 20 years we didn’t get along because our ethics were different, and It drove a wedge between my Mother and I.
    Many years and many scams later, all of which were denounced by myself and ignored by everyone else, they are finally getting a divorse.
    As a family we now use humour to get past the issue. We now laugh about some of the unsophisticated scams that were pulled over the years.
    I’ve never understood why my ethics seem to differ from my family’s, but I’m glad I have them to guide me in life.</p>
