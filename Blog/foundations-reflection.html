    <!-- Reflection
Utilising your journal findings and the high-level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions: -->








    <h2 class="centered">
     What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? 
    </h2>
<p>
  I've learnt that your brain comes up with the answer eventually if you rest it enough along the way. 
  
  <br> I've learnt that your ego can be humbled easily in this profession.
  
  <br> I've learnt that I need to strengthen the link in my brain between my determination and my motivation. If I was as motivated as I am determined, I would be a better human.
</p>
    <h2 class="centered">
     What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
     </h2>
<p>
  I think that you bring your values with you when you code. It's our job as coders to make sure no Class or ID is excluded. 
  
  <br> Empathy is necessary in learning and programming because sometimes you can be so wrong that it's embarrassing. In these times you need people's wisdom and guidence, so that you're not discouraged from learning the craft.
  
  <br>Self-awareness is important in learning and programming because you need to be in touch with yourself and be able to make improvements to yourself in the areas that you feel need work. You need to be able to acknowledge a weakness and address it.
</p>
     <h2 class="centered">
     What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h2>
<p>
  I'm suprised how much the core learning and the tech learning compliment each other.
</p>
    <h2 class="centered">
     What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h2>
<p>
  The thing I found the most challenging was digging deep for meaningful answers to some of the tough questions.
</p>
    <h2 class="centered">
     Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
<p>
  Without it you're not going to make it. It's like climbing Mt Everest in your undies with no food or water.
</p>
    <h2 class="centered">
     Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
<p>
It wasn't a waste of time at all. I found it helped me think about something other than code for a while. 
  <br> After having to break down problems into small parts, I have a new found appreciation for how smart the human brain is.
