  <h1>Classes and ID's</h1>
  <H2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</H2>
  <h3>You should use IDs on elements that appear only once on a page and need to perform a unique function.</h3>
  <div>
  </div>

  <H3>You could achieve the same result by using a Class or an ID attribute, but remember that an ID attribute will get priority over a class attribute.
    You should use the Class attribute when you have multiple elements that serve the same purpose or appear to be the same.
  </H3>

  <h3 id= "centered">This text has been centered using the ID attribute</h3>
  
  <h3 class= "centered">This text has been centered using the Class attribute</h3>
  
  
  <h2 class= "centered" id=right>This H2 tag should be centered because of the class attribute, but see how the ID attribute makes it appear on the right?</h2>
