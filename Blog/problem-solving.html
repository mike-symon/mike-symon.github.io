    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <h2 class="centered">One time that I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <p>
      To be honest, I encounter so many simple problems that I can't even name
      one. I try to get around these problems by reasearching them and trying to
      find lots of short examples at first, but failing that digging a bit
      deeper. If I'm still blocked I go to discord and ask my small, but growing
      network of friends and facillitators a few questions about it. It can feel
      quite frustrating at times, especially when you engage a little too much
      help and end up wasting people's time. I've learned that a lot of things
      can be solved alone eventually, but you may as well just ask because we're
      all going through the same things and the thread could help others in the
      future.
    </p>

    <h2 class="centered">An elegantly solved problem</h2>
    <p>
      I set myself the task of making rainbow text using ID's when I first
      started my blog. After a little bit of Googling and a bit of help and
      encouragement I succeeded, but eventually had no need for the rainbow
      anymore. But I had a problem. I still wanted the rainbow. I used the ID's
      to alter the color properties of all my blog links instead and it looks
      awesome. I felt happy that I had reached my stretch goal and have learned
      that you need to push yourself because it's nobody elses job.

    <h2 class="centered">
      How confident do you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes?
    </h2>
    <h3 class="centered">Pseudocode</h3>
    <p class="centered">Getting pretty confident with this, it's good for brainstorming.</p>
    <h3 class="centered">Trying something</h3>
    <p class="centered">
      I'm confident enough to give something a good try. I want to get better at
      working with branches though.
    </p>
    <h3 class="centered">Rubber ducky method</h3>
    <p class="centered">I practice this with my cat and my girlfriend. I think it works.</p>
    <h3 class="centered">Reading error messages</h3>
    <p class="centered">Getting better at this.</p>
    <h3 class="centered">Console.logging</h3>
    <p class="centered">
      I'm getting better, but need a better understanding of what things to
      target with it.
    </p>
    <h3 class="centered">Googling</h3>
    <p class="centered">Confident.</p>
    <h3 class="centered">Asking your peers for help</h3>
    <p class="centered">
      Reasonably confident. I try not to annoy them unless I'm really stuck
      because they have their own worries.
    </p>
    <h3 class="centered">Asking coaches for help</h3>
    <p class="centered">
      Not as confident as I'd like to be. I feel like I'm asking for too much
      help sometimes.
    </p>
    <h3 class="centered">Improving your process with reflection</h3>
    <p class="centered">
      Pretty confident. I haven't really written anything in 20 years. It's
      strangely therapeutic.
