    <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h2>
      Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
      people
    </h2>
    <p>
      Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can often help people go
      beyond the limits they had placed on themselves, and in some cases even
      the limits nature imposed on them. Studies have shown that stroke
      survivors who engage in repetitive, increasingly challenging exercises can
      regain motor function, and it’s also been proven that people who practice
      doing something in their mind actually get better at it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
      your benefit
    </h2>
    <p>
      One way to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity is by selecting
      an activity that is new, challenging and important to you. Practice the
      activity as frequently as you can and you will forge new neural
      connections. The more the brain is exercised, the stronger and more
      connected it becomes.
    </p>
    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning a new language</li>
      <li>Learning how to play a new instrument</li>
      <li>Listening to some new music</li>
      <li>Meditation</li>
      <li>Brush your teeth with the opposite hand</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is a growth mindset and why it is relevant?</h2>
    <p>
      Most people believe intelligence is predetermined, so they stop trying to
      develop their brain. They tell themselves that they’re not smart enough
      and they simply give up on their dreams. People with a growth mindset
      think the opposite. They keep pushing themselves to learn new skills
      constantly, and the intellectual chasm between them and their peers often
      widens as time goes on. Knowledge is exponential, and the sooner one can
      break through that mental ceiling, the better. Life is not about
      stagnation, it is about growth.
    </p>

    <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
    <p>I guess I had a small revelation.</p>
    <p>
      The fact that experts have yet to determine the limits of the brain’s
      abilities makes me wonder how we became so apathetic as a species. Why do
      we dream so small?
    </p>

    <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
    <p>
      I’m going to see barriers as challenges to overcome, and get better at
      helping myself over them with my research.

    <h2>
      Discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan
      and strategy
    </h2>
    <p>
      I’m going to make a conscious effort to let go of any restrictions I may
      have unknowingly placed on myself. I’m going to practice mindfulness, and
      try and look after my mind as well as my body.
