    <h1>Learning Plan, Part Deux</h1>

    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
I want to build a small company that makes websites for people, and I want to learn how to make games in my spare time. I'm going to make the music and sound effects for the games.
      </p>

    <h2>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</h2>
<p>
  I am hoping to be able to work from home and spend more time with my family instead of commuting.
  <br>In terms of impact, I just want people to enjoy software again. I feel like the internet could be more fun.
</p>
<h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
<p>
  My biggest strength will be my support network. They all wan't to see me succeed.
  <br>My biggest limitations will be my ability to catch up if I fall behind.
</p>

<h2>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h2>
<p>
  I'm not as good as I thought I would be at putting concepts together. I need to think about problems more logically. I need to learn more techniques so that I have a decent toolbox to solve problems with during Bootcamp.
</p>
<h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
</h2>
<p>
  My baby will be born in the next couple of months. I'll need to manage that as well as I can.
  <br>Public speaking isn't my thing, although I am now comfortable speaking in my homegroup.
</p>
<h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p>
  My curiosity, my communication skills, my confidence.
</p>

<h2>What are some areas for development you would like to work on?</h2>
<p>
  I'd like to work on my focus, and on getting to the answer quicker.

</p>

<h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
<p>
  A bit of guidence and support. 
</p>

<h2>What does support look like to you? </h2>
<p>
  Tech support where necessary, or simply just claririfying something or rephrasing a question in a different way and pointing me in the right direction.
</p>

<h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
<p>
  I expect myself to put in 100%, and I intend to suprise myself with what I can achieve in four months.
</p>

<h2>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h2>
<p>I will seek help from my peers, and I will help my peers. </p>

<h2>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
</h2>
<p>
  I will not procrastinate. There's no time for that. I will seek help as soon as I need it, and I will participate fully in the group activities. I will not give up. I will be kind to others.
</p>

    <h1>Learning Plan 1.0</h1>

    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      I want to get into blockchain development to bring accountability and
      transparency to industries and institutions that need it.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am great at self directed learning, but if I’m stuck I don’t feel like
      I’m efficient at getting past the issue.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>

    <p>Resourcefulness, patience, problem solving</p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
      productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and
      industry/community representatives?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I will be doing 10 hour days when I don’t have my night classes for the
      baby I’m expecting soon. I will be working on Saturdays to catch up also.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
    </h2>
    <p>Communicate, research, don’t give up, step back.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will ask in Discord and when nobody replies I will @ somebody. While
      waiting for answers I will do something productive if I can’t move forward
      like eat or stretch etc
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?</h2>
    <p>
      There are some aspects of the course that don’t translate well in the
      Online environment. These are quite commonly trivial technical things.
      Maybe it’s a good idea to take note of these as they come up and feed them
      back into the curiculum.
    </p>
    <div></div>

    <h2>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will be here every day of the week, but sometimes I have midwife and
      scan appointments with my partner. When my baby is born there will be some
      disruption. I will try my best to navigate this at the time, and catch up
      at night or on the weekend.
    </p>
