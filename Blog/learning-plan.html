      <h1>Learning plan</h1>

      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?  </h2>
      <p>   I want to get into blockchain development to bring accountability and transparency to industries  and institutions that need it.</p>
      <div></div>
      <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning?</h2> 
      <p>   I am great at self directed learning, but if I’m stuck I don’t feel like I’m efficient at getting past the issue.</p>
      <div></div>
      <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

      <p>   Resourcefulness, patience, problem solving</p> 
      <div></div>
      <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives?</h2> 

      <p>   I will be doing 10 hour days when I don’t have my night classes for the baby I’m expecting soon. I will be working on Saturdays to catch up also.</p> 
      <div></div>
          <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h2> 
          <p>   Communicate, research, don’t give up, step back.</p> 
          <div></div>
      <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h2> 
      <p>   I will ask in Discord and when nobody replies I will @ somebody. While waiting for answers I will do something productive if I can’t move forward like eat or stretch etc</p>
      <div></div>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?</h2> 
      <p>   There are some aspects of the course that don’t translate well in the Online environment. These are quite commonly trivial technical things. Maybe it’s a good idea to take note of these as they come up and feed them back into the curiculum.</p>
      <div></div>
      
      <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
      <p>   I will be here from 9-5 minimum every day , but sometimes I have midwife and scan appointments with my partner. When my baby is born there will be some disruption. I will try my best to navigate this at the time, and catch up at night or on the weekend.</p>
