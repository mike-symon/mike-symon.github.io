      Learning plan

      * What is your long term goal or career pathway?  I want to get into blockchain development to bring accountability and transparency to industries  and institutions that need it.
      
      * A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning? I am great at self directed learning, but if I’m stuck I don’t feel like I’m efficient at getting past the issue.
      
      * What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      * resourcefulness, patience, kindness
      * 
      * A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives? 
      * I will be doing 10 hour days when I don’t have my night classes for the baby I’m expecting soon. I will be working on Saturdays to catch up also.
      * 
          * What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
          * Communicate, research, don’t give up, step back.
          * 
      * A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way? I will ask in Discord and when nobody replies I will @ somebody. While waiting for answers I will do something productive if I can’t move forward like eat or stretch etc
      * 
      * A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?
      There are some aspects of the course that don’t translate well in the Online environment. These are quite commonly trivial technical things. Maybe it’s a good idea to take note of these as they come up and feed them back into the curiculum.
      
      * Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      * I will be here from 9-5 minimum every day , but sometimes I have midwife and scan appointments with my partner. When my baby is born there will be some disruption. I will try my best to navigate this at the time, and catch up at night or on the weekend.
